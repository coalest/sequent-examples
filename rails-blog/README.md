# Rails & Sequent

This is an example project on how to add Sequent to an existing Rails application.
This Rails application is the one created from the [Rails Getting Started Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

As a final step Sequent is added and for each `Article` also a `Post` is created. This of course would not make any sense, but it just a demonstration on how to add Sequent to a Rails application.

See [Rails & Sequent](https://www.sequent.io/docs/rails-sequent.html) for the latest step-by-step guide.
